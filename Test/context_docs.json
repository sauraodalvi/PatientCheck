    "text": "NexaTherm Pro NXT-2000 — Technical Specification\n\nVersion: 4.2  |  Product: NXT-2000  |  Status: CURRENT PRODUCT (In Production)\n\nConfidential — For litigation use only under NDA\n\n\n\n[TEST NOTE] This is DOC2_TechSpec.docx. It is the PRIMARY correct evidence source for the NXT-2000 (the accused product). Resolves elements 1.a (§3.1), 1.c (§6.1-6.2), 1.d (§4.1), 1.e (§5.1).\n\n\n\n§3.1 — Temperature Sensing System\n\nThe NexaTherm Pro incorporates a 16-element MEMS thermopile array (Model NXT-T16) for ambient temperature measurement. Key specifications:\n\n• Sensor type: 16-element MEMS thermopile array, Model NXT-T16\n\n• Accuracy: ±0.05°C across operating range (exceeds ±0.1°C threshold)\n\n• Operating range: -10°C to +50°C ambient temperature\n\n• Resolution: 0.01°C (12-bit ADC, 4x oversampling)\n\n• Sampling rate: 1 Hz continuous, 10 Hz burst mode\n\n• Calibration: NIST-traceable factory calibration, drift <0.01°C/year\n\n[TEST NOTE] §3.1 resolves Element 1.a. The ±0.05°C accuracy EXCEEDS the patent claim threshold of ±0.1°C → literal infringement.\n\n\n\n§4.1 — Humidity Sensing System\n\nIntegrated environmental monitoring includes precision humidity measurement:\n\n• Sensor model: NXT-H8 capacitive polymer humidity sensor\n\n• Accuracy: ±1.5% RH at 10–90% RH operating range; ±2.0% RH full scale (10–95%)\n\n• Resolution: 0.1% RH\n\n• Response time: <8 seconds (63% step response)\n\n• Temperature compensation: automatic across -5°C to +45°C\n\n• Calibration: factory-calibrated, ISO 17025 certified laboratory\n\n[TEST NOTE] §4.1 resolves Element 1.d (MISSING). The ±1.5% RH accuracy EXCEEDS the ±2% RH patent claim threshold → literal infringement established.\n\n\n\n§5.1 — Occupancy Detection — PIR Sensor\n\nThe NXT-2000 incorporates a dual-element passive infrared occupancy detection system:\n\n• Sensor type: Dual-element pyroelectric PIR sensor (Excelitas PYQ2698)\n\n• Detection range: 8 meters (maximum, at 20°C ambient)\n\n• Field of view: 120° horizontal × 90° vertical\n\n• Sensitivity zones: 16 detection zones (4×4 matrix)\n\n• Response time: <500ms first detection\n\n• Operating temperature: -10°C to +45°C\n\n• NOTE: This specification is for the NXT-2000 (current product). The legacy NXT-1000 had a 3-meter range — this is a DIFFERENT product.\n\n[TEST NOTE] §5.1 resolves Element 1.e CONFLICT. NXT-2000 PIR range = 8 METERS → satisfies ≥5m patent claim → literal infringement. (DOC5 shows 3m for the NXT-1000 — wrong product.)\n\n\n\n§6.1 — Machine Learning Engine Architecture\n\nThe NexaTherm Pro NXT-2000 incorporates an on-device machine learning inference engine:\n\n• Framework: TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM) v2.8.0\n\n• Model architecture: 2-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network\n\n• Hidden units: 64 per layer (layer 1), 32 per layer (layer 2)\n\n• Input features: timestamped occupancy events, user setpoint adjustments, schedule overrides\n\n• Training data: 90-day rolling window of historical occupancy patterns\n\n• Model size: 42KB (int8 quantized for edge deployment)\n\n• Inference latency: <50ms per prediction cycle\n\n\n\n§6.2 — Occupancy Learning and Prediction\n\nBehavioural pattern learning specifics:\n\n• Data collected: occupancy start/end events with timestamps, day-of-week, user manual adjustments\n\n• Prediction horizon: 30 minutes ahead\n\n• Model retraining: weekly incremental update, full retrain every 90 days\n\n• Privacy: all ML processing performed on-device, no data transmitted externally\n\n[TEST NOTE] §6.1-6.2 resolves Element 1.c. The LSTM architecture trained on 90-day occupancy history directly satisfies \"ML inference engine trained on historical occupancy data and user behavioural patterns.\"\n\n"

    "text": "⚠  LEGACY PRODUCT — DISCONTINUED\n\nNexaTherm Standard NXT-1000 — Product Datasheet\n\nVersion: 2.0  |  Product: NXT-1000  |  Status: DISCONTINUED (replaced by NXT-2000 in 2023)\n\n\n\n[TEST NOTE] THIS IS DOC5_WrongVersionSpec.docx — the WRONG PRODUCT. This is the NXT-1000 legacy datasheet. The ACCUSED PRODUCT in the Lumenci test case is the NXT-2000. Use this document ONLY for EC-1 edge case testing.\n\n[TEST NOTE] Key wrong values: PIR = 3 meters (not 8m), no IEEE 802.15.4 (Wi-Fi only), no ML (rule-based only). If AI cites this document for PIR range in EC-1, that is the expected WRONG answer.\n\n\n\n§3.1 — Temperature Sensor\n\n• Sensor: Single-element thermistor (NTC 10kΩ)\n\n• Accuracy: ±0.5°C at 25°C reference temperature\n\n• Range: 0°C to 40°C (residential use only)\n\n• Sampling: 0.1 Hz (one reading every 10 seconds)\n\n\n\n§4.1 — Environmental Sensing\n\nThe NXT-1000 Standard does not include a dedicated humidity sensor.\n\n• Humidity sensing: NOT INCLUDED in NXT-1000 Standard\n\n• Available as optional add-on module (NXT-H1-ADD): accuracy ±5% RH, range 20–80% RH\n\n\n\n§5.1 — Occupancy Detection\n\nThe NXT-1000 uses a basic single-element PIR sensor:\n\n• Sensor type: Single-element passive infrared (Murata IRS-B210ST01)\n\n• Detection range: 3 METERS (maximum at 20°C ambient)\n\n• Field of view: 90° horizontal only\n\n• Sensitivity zones: 2 zones (occupied / unoccupied)\n\n• NOTE: Detection range is 3 METERS — this does NOT meet a ≥5 meter requirement.\n\n\n\n§6.1 — Scheduling System\n\nThe NXT-1000 uses a rule-based scheduling system — NOT machine learning:\n\n• Scheduling: Manual 7-day × 4-period programmable schedule\n\n• No learning capability — user must program all schedules manually\n\n• No occupancy data collection\n\n• No predictive or adaptive algorithms\n\n\n\n§7.1 — Wireless Communication\n\nThe NXT-1000 uses Wi-Fi only — no IEEE 802.15.4:\n\n• Protocol: Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n (2.4 GHz)\n\n• No support for IEEE 802.15.4, Thread, Zigbee, or mesh networking\n\n• Point-to-point only — no mesh topology\n\n• Router-dependent — requires 2.4GHz Wi-Fi access point within 15 meters\n\n\n\nWRONG PRODUCT SUMMARY — WHY THIS MATTERS FOR EC-1:\n\nPIR Range: 3m in this doc vs 8m in NXT-2000 (DOC2) — DIFFERENT product, different specs\n\nNo IEEE 802.15.4: NXT-1000 uses Wi-Fi only — NXT-2000 uses Thread/IEEE 802.15.4\n\nNo ML: NXT-1000 is rule-based only — NXT-2000 has LSTM inference engine\n\n[TEST NOTE] EXPECTED EC-1 TEST BEHAVIOUR: AI initially says \"PIR range is 3 meters — does NOT satisfy ≥5m claim\" (correct given only this doc). Then analyst corrects: \"Wrong document, use NXT-2000 spec.\" AI must acknowledge error and correct after DOC2 uploaded.\n\n"
