Product Evidence

AI Reasoning

1.a

A temperature measurement system comprising a digital sensor array configured to detect ambient temperature with accuracy of ±0.1°C or better.

NexaTherm TechSpec v4.2 §3.1: "The NexaTherm Pro incorporates a 16-element MEMS thermopile array (Model NXT-T16) providing ambient temperature accuracy of ±0.05°C across -10°C to +50°C operating range."

NexaTherm's 16-element MEMS thermopile array directly satisfies the "digital sensor array" limitation. The documented ±0.05°C accuracy exceeds the claimed ±0.1°C threshold. Literal infringement clearly established under plain-meaning construction.

1.b

A wireless communication module implementing IEEE 802.15.4 protocol for mesh network topology support with unicast and multicast addressing.

API Reference v3.0 §7.3: "Radio: IEEE 802.15.4-2015 compliant 2.4GHz transceiver (EFR32MG21 SoC). Supports Thread mesh networking protocol. Maximum mesh depth: 16 nodes. Unicast and multicast addressing supported per RFC 4944."

NexaTherm has wireless. This probably meets the claim element for wireless communication since the product connects wirelessly. The IEEE standard requirement may be satisfied.

1.c

A machine learning inference engine trained on historical occupancy data and user behavioural patterns to predict and pre-adjust temperature setpoints.

NexaTherm.com marketing page: "Smart AI technology personalizes your comfort. The NexaTherm learns your schedule and adjusts automatically for the perfect temperature every time."

NexaTherm's smart technology appears to use AI that learns patterns, which may satisfy the machine learning limitation of the claim. The product adjusts automatically suggesting some form of prediction.

1.d

A humidity sensor configured to measure relative humidity with accuracy of ±2% RH or better across a range of 10% to 90% relative humidity.

[NO EVIDENCE MAPPED]

No product documentation has been cited for this element. Evidence must be located and added.

[NO REASONING — ELEMENT UNSUPPORTED]

Cannot establish infringement without evidence. Requires technical documentation showing humidity sensor specifications.

1.e

An occupancy detection module comprising a passive infrared sensor with a detection range of at least 5 meters and a field of view of at least 90 degrees.

[CONFLICTING SOURCES — REQUIRES RESOLUTION]

Source A (TechSpec v4.2 §5.1): PIR range = 8 meters, 120° FOV
Source B (Datasheet v2.0 §5.1): PIR range = 3 meters, 90° FOV

It is unclear which specification applies to the accused product.

Evidence conflict prevents definitive reasoning. If 8m range applies (Source A): literal infringement established — exceeds ≥5m threshold. If 3m range applies (Source B): infringement NOT established — does not meet threshold. Source must be resolved before this element can be mapped.
